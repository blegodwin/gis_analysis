## Project Overview

The analysis utilises various geospatial datasets to explore Nigeria's administrative boundaries, protected areas, biodiversity zones, road networks, bioclimatic zones, ecological zones, land cover, and soil resources. This geospatial data allows for the mapping and visualization of key environmental features, which is crucial for understanding the relationship between land use and sustainable development goals (SDGs) focusing on Goals 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land).

The ultimate goal is to integrate these spatial datasets with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to support sustainable land management practices, conservation efforts, and policy-making. By mapping and visualizing critical land sector data, the project aims to provide valuable insights that will inform sustainable development and environmental conservation initiatives in Nigeria.

## Objectives

1. Administrative Boundaries: Mapping and visualizing the administrative boundaries within Nigeria, including national and state-level boundaries.
2. Protected Areas: Identifying and visualizing protected and conserved areas in Nigeria to understand their distribution and the designation types.
3. Road Networks: Analyzing and mapping the road networks across Nigeria to understand their spatial distribution and connectivity.
4. Bioclimatic and Ecological Zones: Exploring and mapping ecological zones, agro-ecological zones, and biodiversity hotspots to understand the diverse bioclimatic and ecological environments within Nigeria.
5. Land Cover: Identifying and mapping land cover categories, focusing on planted forests, to assess forest distribution and coverage.
6. Soil Resources: Examining the soil resources available in Nigeria to gain insights into soil types, quality, and distribution.


## Data Visualisation and Mapping

**Boundary**
Nigeria's administrative boundaries are defined using geospatial data to understand regional demarcations. The country is divided into several administrative units, including states and local government areas.

**Protected Areas**
Protected areas are vital for biodiversity conservation. These areas are designated to preserve natural habitats and wildlife.

**Roads**
Road networks are essential for accessibility and development. Understanding road distribution helps identify connectivity and potential areas for infrastructure development.

 **Bioclimatic and Ecological Zones**
**Ecological Zones**
Ecological zones represent areas with specific ecological characteristics, including climate, flora, and fauna. Nigeria's ecological zones include various environments, from tropical rainforests to savannahs.

**Agro-Ecological Zones**
Agro-ecological zones are areas with distinct agricultural potential and climatic conditions, influencing crop selection and farming practices.

**Biodiversity**
Biodiversity hotspots are regions with a high level of endemic species that are under threat. Mapping these areas is crucial for conservation efforts.

**Land Cover**
**Planted Forests**
Planted forests contribute to environmental sustainability by enhancing carbon sequestration, preventing soil erosion, and supporting biodiversity.

## Insights

Nigeria, located in West Africa, boasts diverse natural features and abundant resources. The country hosts protected areas that safeguard its unique biodiversity and features an extensive road network connecting regions both domestically and beyond its borders.

Within Nigeria's protected areas, there are 925 forest reserves, along with a single community forest and a strict nature reserve, highlighting the country's commitment to preserving its natural heritage

Nigeria's ecological zones encompass a rich variety of environments, including tropical dry forests, moist forests, mountain systems, rainforests, shrublands, and water bodies. The tropical mountain system stands as the largest among these ecological zones, contributing to the nation's rich natural heritage.

Regarding agro-ecological zones, Nigeria exhibits a wide range of climates and agricultural potential. These zones encompass various categories, such as Tropical-Arid, Tropical-Dry Semi-Arid, Tropical-Moist Semi-Arid, Tropical-Sub-Humid, Tropical-Humid, Tropical-Humid (year-round), Temperate-Arid, Temperate-Dry Semi-Arid, Temperate-Moist Semi-Arid, Temperate-Sub-Humid, Temperate-Humid, Temperate-Humid (year-round), Boreal-Arid, Boreal-Dry Semi-Arid, Boreal-Moist Semi-Arid, Boreal-Sub-humid, Boreal-Humid, and Boreal-Humid (year-round). The Boreal-Dry Semi-Arid zone stands as the largest, fostering diverse agricultural practices and crop cultivation in Nigeria.
